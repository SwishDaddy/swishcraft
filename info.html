								<h3>Basic Ideas</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Vanilla Minecraft is just too easy</li>
									<li>Mobs should be harder and more prolific</li>
									<li>Bosses and dungeons should be available for adventurers</li>
									<li>More survival mechanics like Hunger and Thirst should increase the challenge without being frustrating</li>							
									<li>Public servers are more fun because you can play with lots of other crafters</li>
									<li>An economy to make things worth buying and selling would add a whole new dynamic to the game</li>
									<li>"Man is The Deadliest Game"... PvP: no-one kills players like other players!</li>
									<li>Battle and Violence should be defining characteristics for survival</li>
									<li>Cooperation (PvE) should usually be more fun and profitable than competition... but not always!</li>

								<h3>A Note From SwishDaddy</h3>
								<p>So yeah, basically I wanted a more challenging Minecraft experience... and I wanted to share it with you. I'm stoked to see what sort of things you build, and how you like the world! <a href="mailto:swishcraft@swishersolutions.com">Drop me a line</a> if you have any questions or comments! And if you see me out and about in the world, feel free to say Hi!</p>
								<p>
								And just so ya know... I am a capricious and mercurial OP/Admin (or Overlord? God, even?), and I may wreak great havoc or bestow great blessings without notice or reason... but I won't be a dick about it!

								<h2>History</h2>
								<!--<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ft_ka_jail.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->
								<p>I started playing Minecraft several years ago, around v1.8 or so. I've always played with a small group of friends, and we've spent countless hours in many worlds. When we started getting good, we started adding different mod packs to spice things up. At this point, we routinely play with 50 to 100 mods... and it makes for some whacky worlds, for sure!</p>
								<p>However, there's really only so many cool things just a few guys can do, even with all the crazy mods out there... and I feel like we've reached a plateau. So in order to change things up and bring in some new ideas, I decided to open a world to the public.</p>
								<p>Of course, this introduces a slew of issues, because you can't just trust the general public to be cool like you can your buddies, and you can't really expect new players to install all the necessary stuff to get mods to work.</p>
								<p>Enter plugins, which change the world without requiring players to do anything special at all, and allow us to add in quite a few of the features I've come to love in my mods... namely things that increase the survival challenge.</p>
								<p>Plugins also offer cool features that you can't really get in mods, like an economy with money and jobs, and arena battles... and the all-important ability to handle griefing and other unwanted behavior.</p>								
								<p>So I've been spending time researching plugins and putting together the ones I like, and even more time actually building a small part of the world at spawn (Ft. Kickass), as well as a few other surprises.</p>
								<p>I hope you like the world and decide to settle in a bit... build some cool stuff and whatnot.</p>
