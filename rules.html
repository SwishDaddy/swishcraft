								<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ft_ka_jail.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Now, I understand shit-talking is an important part of any battle ground, and I'm not trying to be anyone's Mommy here... after all, this server is intended for grown-ups (if it were a movie, it'd be rated R for violence and language), but there are certain things I just don't want on my server, and the type of players I'm looking for will agree. There's no need for racist hate speech, or anti-LBGTQ bullshit, or political preaching or religious recruiting. There's no need to behave like children (even if you <i>are</i> a children...). Really, man... there's just no need to be a dick.</p>
								<p>For example... a comment like "Ha ha fag! Suck my balls!" uttered to a defeated enemy to crow in glory is perfectly acceptable... however, hate-fueled statements like "God hates fags" or "Die faggit" will get you perma-banned.</p>
								<p>Here's another one... if you build a 300m tall gigantic penis, I will come and gaze in wonder... but if you build so much as a 13 block swaztika, I'll be happy to fuckin' ban your nazi bitch-ass in a heartbeat.</p>
								<p>Really, it's all about context. Use good judgement when talking shit and doing shit, and when reading the shit-talk of others. Be careful not to go on witch hunts... but at the same time, don't tolerate hate.</p>
								<p>Certain words are banned from use already... you know what they are. Please don't try to circumvent them by using other characters, (like "$" instead of "s" and such). If something you type is censored, roll with it... and maybe not talk that particular shit anymore.</p>
